### Requires

- `data`: data to process
- `config`: database configuration

### Ensures

- `result`: processed and stored data with confirmation
- if database is unreachable: error report with connection diagnostics

### Errors

- `db-failure`: database connection failed after all retry attempts

### Strategies

- when connection fails: retry up to 3 times with backoff
- when timeout: try with reduced batch size
