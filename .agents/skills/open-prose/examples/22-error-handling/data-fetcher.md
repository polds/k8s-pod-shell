### Requires

- `api-endpoint`: the API to query

### Ensures

- `data`: fetched API response data
- if api is unavailable: cached data flagged as stale

### Errors

- `no-data`: neither live nor cached data available

### Strategies

- when rate limited: retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
- when timeout: try once more with extended timeout
