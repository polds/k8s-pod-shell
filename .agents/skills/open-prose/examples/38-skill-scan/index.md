### Services

- `discovery`
- `triage`
- `malicious-scanner`
- `exfil-scanner`
- `injection-scanner`
- `permission-analyzer`
- `hook-analyzer`
- `synthesizer`

### Requires

- `mode`: scan mode -- "quick" (triage only), "standard" (triage + deep on concerns), or "deep" (full analysis)
- `focus`: specific category to focus on (optional: malicious, exfiltration, injection, permissions, hooks)
- `skill-filter`: specific skill name or path to scan (optional, default: all discovered)

### Ensures

- `audit`: security audit report with overall risk rating, findings by severity, and remediation recommendations
- if no skills found: brief report listing directories checked
- each skill scanned has: individual risk rating and safe-to-use verdict

### Strategies

- when mode is standard and triage is clean with high confidence: skip deep scan for that skill
- when critical vulnerability found mid-scan: alert immediately, do not wait for full scan
- when scanner fails: continue with remaining scanners (graceful degradation)
