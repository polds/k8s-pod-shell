### Services

- `scout`
- `parser`
- `miner`
- `qualifier`
- `author`
- `organizer`

### Requires

- `mode`: "full" (analyze everything), "incremental" (new logs only), or "check" (inventory only)
- `min-frequency`: minimum times a pattern must appear to qualify (default: 3)
- `focus`: filter to specific area, e.g., "git", "testing" (optional)

### Ensures

- `result`: generated .prose programs for mature workflow patterns, organized by domain
- if mode is check: inventory of available log sources
- if no patterns are ready: status report with maturity update

### Strategies

- when pattern is still emerging (3-5 hits): note it but do not automate yet
- when pattern is established (6-15 hits): good automation candidate
- when pattern is proven (16+ hits): strong automation candidate
- when pattern is declining: may be obsolete, skip
