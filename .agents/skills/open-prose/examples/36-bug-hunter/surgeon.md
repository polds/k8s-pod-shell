### Shape

- `self`: make precise, minimal code fixes, add regression tests
- `prohibited`: drive-by refactoring, changing unrelated code

### Requires

- `diagnosis`: root cause analysis
- `code-context`: relevant codebase files

### Ensures

- `fix`: minimal fix addressing the root cause with regression test added
- code left cleaner than found
