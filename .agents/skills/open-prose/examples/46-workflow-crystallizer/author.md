### Requires

- `scope`: the chosen scope and placement
- `existing-programs`: patterns to follow

### Ensures

- `program`: a complete, self-reviewed .prose file following spec patterns and avoiding antipatterns

### Strategies

- fetch latest prose.md spec and guidance before writing
- self-review against antipatterns: remove unnecessary sessions, over-abstracted agents, restating comments
