# state

Specifications for the state backends available to OpenProse programs. Each backend trades off latency, durability, and query power.

## Contents

- `filesystem.md` — file-based state; reads and writes to the local filesystem under a session directory
- `in-context.md` — ephemeral state held in the LLM context window; lost when the session ends
- `sqlite.md` — SQLite-backed persistence; durable local storage with SQL query support
- `postgres.md` — PostgreSQL-backed persistence; durable remote storage for multi-agent and multi-host programs
